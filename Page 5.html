      <p>The critically acclaimed movie <cite> The Dark Crystal </cite> was directed by Jim Henson and Frank Oz in 1982. It is a dark fantasy film that scared 80s kids and adults at the time because of the reptile/dinosaur/bird-like creatures known as the Skeksis. </p>

    <th> The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</th>
    <P> The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance was a Netflix series of ten episodes that premiered in 2019 with just one season.</P>
    <th>The Muppet Show</th>
    <P> The Muppet Show was a 5 season tv show that ran from 1976 to 1981. It featured Kermit as the host of the show, and he welcomed many celebrity guests onto the show during its 5 year run. </P>
    <th> Muppet Babies</th> 
    <P> Muppet Babies was an ABC show. It ran from 1984 to 1991 for eight seasons. By 1990, Jim Henson's health had declined rapidly, and he passed away on May 16th, 1990 from Pnumonia complications.</P>
    <th> The Jim Henson Hour</th>
    <P> The Jim Henson Hour was a mixed bag in my opinion. It ran for one season in 1989, but reruns ran until after Jim's passing until 1992. It contained behind the scenes clips from many Muppet productions, and it also was Jim's final show he ever starred in.</P>
