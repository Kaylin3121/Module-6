  <th>Monopoly</th> 
  <P> Monopoly is a popular board game where you learn how to buy properties. I have played this game before myself, starting with the Las Vegas edition followed by the classic game and then the Disney/Pixar one.</P>
  <p> This is the Monopoly Plus game trailer.</p>

  <th>The Game of Life</th>
  <P> In The Game of Life, you start with colored cars, moving around a gameboard trying to retire. You also can choose which path you want to take as well. You can either Go to College or Get a Job. The goal of this game is to teach everyone about life and how to retire at the end of their work life. I have played this game numerous times over the years, and its one of my favorite games to play. </P>
